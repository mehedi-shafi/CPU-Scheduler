Round robin seemed pretty easy when first thought. But simply it isn't.
You can look into my C++ code [here](https://gist.github.com/mehedi-shafi/2325e896ac6e5f03393dadba3b08c51d)

it became so complex when tried to keep track of things. xD

Or maybe I am just a bad coder. 

however, objectifying the processes seemed better idea to me. 

###Tip
  ** Print the queues during the run to understand how the queues are getting generated and working 

good luck
